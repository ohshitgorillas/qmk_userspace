# Planck rev7 Ortholinear 40% Keyboard: A Review

I used the Planck keyboard for three weeks. Here are my unfiltered thoughts.

## Why would you do this to yourself? What's the point?

I got these questions a lot in various forms. And they are fair, to be honest. I often looked down at the Planck and asked myself the very same questions.

Some of you are already deep into this hobby and already use keyboards that most people would consider unusable abominations. You already get it. Those who aren't/don't... this review is for you.

There *are* reasons, but first, we need to start thinking about keyboards a bit differently. Let's start by stepping down to 60% and slaying a sacred cow: the arrow keys.

### Fuck Your Arrow Keys
That's right, I said it. Go ahead: gasp, boo, hiss, clutch your fucking pearls. 

To be clear, this isn't about *not using* arrow keys. Everyone needs arrow keys. What you don't need are *dedicated* arrow keys.

If this upsets you, chances are you're using a bog-standard full-size or TKL keyboard. These are very straightforward to use: if you want F5, you reach up and press the F5 key; if you want Print Screen, you reach over and press the Print Screen key. Easy peasy.

Here's a new way of thinking about this, though: all that reaching isn't just inefficient, it's poor ergonomics. What if the most critical functions were always right under your fingers on the home row? Stop reaching and start layering.

This isn't exactly groundbreaking: cut, copy, and paste are critical, indispensable features that have never had dedicated keys on any standardized modern layout. You don't reach across the keyboard for a key, you *chord* Ctrl (or Cmd) + X, C, or V. I'm just taking that same logic and applying it to the arrow keys.

Take Caps Lock, for example: it's a useless fuck of a key taking up prime home row real estate. With the magic of programmable mechanical keyboards, we can transform it into a key that opens up a layer with things like Enter, Backspace, Delete, and arrow keys all within easy reach of home row. With the full might of QMK, we can have Caps Lock still activate on keypresses, and bring even more cool features to the home row like modifiers as well. Yes, it takes a little elbow grease to get there. Yes, it takes some retraining of your muscle memory... but for serious typists, the payoff can be significant. And fun to configure!

The takeaway here is that there are other ways of thinking about typing than the "one key per function" paradigm... and those alternatives can be an improvement in efficiency, speed, and ergonomics if you've got the patience to learn it.

### The Keyboard Dark Arts
I'm a 60% user at heart. That's my sweet spot. I knew this before I bought the Planck, and I'm genuinely proud of my function layers—I find them extremely efficient and ergonomic.

So why the fuck did I buy a 40% keyboard? An ortholinear one, no less?

Because I knew those function layers could be improved, but I couldn't grasp how. I was stuck in a rut with my layers, but I wanted to push forward. I wanted more. I wanted *better*. I saw the Planck as my ticket out.

The Planck was never meant to be a daily driver—it was an internship. I saw it as a masterclass in constraint-driven design; a rich tapestry of assumption-busting flexibility. Strip away a shitload of keys, shrink the spacebar down and add thumb keys to compensate, and suddenly you're forced to rethink everything: where does Enter go? Backspace? Where's the fucking right Shift? How do you type numbers or symbols without losing your mind?

There's no universal answer. Everyone has to figure out what matters to them, what they'll sacrifice, and how to map the missing keys to layers in a way that makes sense to their brain and fingers. The result is a layout that is custom-fitted like leather to each person.

The problem is so complex that an entire ecosystem—QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard)—exists just to solve it as flexibly and personally as possible. It's not just firmware; it's a programming language for keyboards. The barrier to entry is significant, but if you're a serious typist, so is the potential payoff.

And it's that knowledge I was after—the keyboard dark arts, as I call them. The Planck wasn't just a keyboard; it was a crash course in the most advanced aspects of keyboard timing and layering.

I knew going in that this would be painful. I knew I'd hate it. But if I wanted to actually push forward and improve my setup, I knew I needed a trial by fire.

And that's what I got. We'll talk more about that later.


## The Review Portion of the Review



## The Good Shit
Let's cover what I really liked about the Planck.

### Thumb keys are the way and the light.
Seriously, having multiple keys for my thumbs instead of one giant spacebar is fucking brilliant. 

Why isn't this standard? Why is it so hard to find a goodk 60% keyboard with split spacebar support?

- **Diving deep into QMK was a trip.** Vial is great, but getting my hands dirty with proper QMK code to nail my dual-use keys and home-row mods was incredibly satisfying. It's like unlocking the keyboard's final form.
- **This thing is comically small, and I love it.** Tossing it in a bag is nothing. It makes my 60% look like a battleship. It's not practical for me full-time, but the portability is fucking undeniable.


## The Bullshit I Couldn't Stand
- **My muscle memory is now a complete disaster.** After a few weeks with the Planck, I can barely type on a normal staggered keyboard. I look like a goddamn beginner pecking at the keys. Everything feels wrong.
- **The single-wide spacebar can go fuck itself.** I thought I'd get used to it. I did not. Hitting space with my right thumb felt alien and I was constantly mashing the key next to it. Give me a split spacebar or give me death.
- **The mental overhead is exhausting.** Remembering where I put the ampersand or the damn numbers on layer 3 was a constant cognitive load. It broke my flow when coding or writing. I need my number row. Sue me.
- **It feels like a cheap toy.** Coming from a solid aluminum board like the LX60, the Planck feels... well, it feels like a cheap piece of plastic. It's light, which is good for travel, but it just feels flimsy as hell.

## So, What Did I Learn?
This whole experiment was about pushing my boundaries and seeing what was on the other side. Here's what I'm taking with me:
- **Home Row Mods are the shit.** This is a revelation. Having modifiers on the home row is a massive efficiency boost, and I'm never going back.
- **Mastering dual-key timing is a superpower.** I finally nailed the timing for using Caps Lock as a tap-hold layer key, something I could never get right in Vial. It took diving deep into QMK's advanced timing features, but now it's flawless. I can have my layer and my Caps Lock too.
- **MT3 profile is legit.** It's comfortable as hell and the deep scoops feel amazing. I'm a convert.
- **ABS keycaps can still fuck off.** Yeah, they shine. PBT for life.
- **60% is my home.** This experiment solidified it for me. I need my number row and a layout that doesn't make me feel like I'm solving a puzzle every time I need to type a fucking exclamation point. The Planck was a fun, educational, and occasionally infuriating detour, but I'm glad to be back to a real keyboard.
